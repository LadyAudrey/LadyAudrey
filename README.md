### Projects on Hold üïõ:

#### Debugging the Coders' Mind - A coding educational tool
  
* *TypeScript | React | Next | NodeJs | Taliwind | Supabase | AuthO | Vercel* *
    
Goal: Many beginner programmers get caught in negative spirals while learning how to code. Applying my previous knowledge about thoughtwork, effecient learning and boosting executive functioning, I hope to help new developers have a kinder learning curve while learning their first language.
    
Built in collaboration with an amazing Fullstack developer, Kenson Johnson @kensonjohnson. It is connected to the backend, and deployed, but currently the content is minimal and a lot of components to build.

Typescript | React | Next | Taliwind
    
Goal: Website to explore dynamic web pages and to display art of Taylor Swift. Currently combining 2 vanilla Js sites into 1 React/ Next site
