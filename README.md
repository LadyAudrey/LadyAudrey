# Hello there!

## My name is Audrey Evergreene, I am changing careers from healthcare into software engineering, focused on Front End web-develoment, based in Portland, Or.

Learning in progress: React, Next, CSS Frameworks, OOP and Design Patterns, Design, Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Main Project in the Works:
#### Debugging the Coders' Mind - A coding educational tool
  
TypeScript | React | Next | NodeJs | Taliwind | Supabase | AuthoO | Vercel
    
Goal: Many beginner programmers get caught in intense shame spirals while learning how to code. Applying my previous knowledge about thoughtwork, effecient learning and boosting executive functioning, I hope to help new developers have a kinder learning curve while learning their first language.
    
    Built in collaboration with an amazing Fullstack developer, Kenson Johnson (https://github.com/kensonjohnson) . It is connected to the backend, and deployed, but currently the content is minimal and I still have a lot of components to build.
